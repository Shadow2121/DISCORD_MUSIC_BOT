# DISCORD_MUSIC_BOT
It's a discord music bot

It dose all work like playing songes you asked for and addition to that I added some functionality to it so I can give the commands by voice.(But it is not detecting voice from other use because it uses the input from microphone not from screen)

Prefix for this bot is ">".

List of commands:
  1. join
  2. leave
  3. play
  4. pause
  5. stop
  6. resume
